# demode-dos-game
## VGA 256 color 320x200 DOS shoot'em up coded with C without sound

Name Pun: demode ("dated" in Turkish), d-mode, (and may be) destruction mode :)

It's a rather clumsy, clich√©-filled and I think, unnecessarily difficult game.
Still, it is a work that I spent a lot of time on and enjoyed while design and coding.

When I coded it I compiled it with Turbo C on a PII 233 pc. It must be DOS or Windows 95, I'm not sure.
Nowadays, to do the same thing you will probably need either a non-64 bit operating system or a virtual machine with old DOS/Windows installed.
I can even say that the same conditions are required to play, it is such a historical development.

You can find the DOSBox package as a zip in the this repo ready to play. 
After opening the zip file, you can start the game by running the dmd.bat file.

Here is the controls:

	Move left                 : Left arrow
	Move right                : Right arrow
	Move up                   : Up arrow
	Move down                 : Down arrow

	Pause game                : +
	Skip intermission screens : Esc, Enter
	Exit game                 : Esc

And here is the cheat codes, just in case:
